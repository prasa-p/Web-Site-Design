<br/>
<p>One of my passions is travelling. Travel involves visiting new places and 
    meeting new people and having varied experiences. I come originally from 
    Canada and have travelled to Europe. I remember the quote by Samuel 
    Johnson: <i>“All travel has its advantages. If the passenger visits better 
    countries, he may learn to improve his own. And if fortune carries him to 
    worse, he may learn to enjoy it”.</i> I have had the luck of visiting better 
    countries and I believe my travel experiences have taught me a lot about 
    human life and helped me expand the way I see things. This summer I had to opportunity
to travel to the three beautiful cities. Learn more about my experience by clicking on the city below. </p>

    Paris</h2>
<p>We arrived at Gare du Nord by train (with Thalys, the high speed train) and then took the subway to our hotel, Mercure Opéra Garnier. I loved this hotel, the rooms were nice and clean and the breakfast in the morning was very good. You can see most of the main highlights starting from here.

    As soon as we unpacked, we headed for the Eiffel tower. But we did it with a detour, so we had the opportunity to do some sightseeing on the way. The first important building we saw was the Opéra Garnier.  (Well, we were staying at hotel Opéra Garnier!) It’s a beautiful building.
    If you just walk down ‘Avenue de L’Opéra’, you reach Place a Malraux. Here you can see ‘Palais Royal’ and walk towards the world famous museum ‘The Louvre’.

    Here alone you could spend a few days trying to see all the artwork this museum has to offer!
    After the Louvre, we went through the Jardin des Tuileries. This is gorgeous on a sunny day such as we had. You can walk all the way to Place de la Concorde, which is the biggest square in Paris. Here you can see the Obelisk from Luxor. This obelisk is thousands of years old and was a gift from Egypt.

    On the other side of the square starts the famous Avenue des Champs Elysées  This street is known in France as ‘la plus belle avenue du monde’ (= the most beautiful avenue in the World) and for its upscale shopping. This is also the place where every year the Tour de France ends.
    At the end of the Champs Elysées you find the Arc de Triomphe. This monument stands on Place Charles de Gaulle or also known as Place de l’Etoile. This is an impressive monument with in the center the ‘Body of the Unknown Soldier’ which represents all soldiers who have died in battle. There is also an eternal flame which burns in memory of the dead, who were never identified.

    We walked towards Petit Palais and Grand Palais, to cross Pont Alexandre III and had a look at Hôtel des Invalides. Following the path next to the Seine, this would bring us to our highlight of the day: ‘La Tour Eiffel’.
    At the foot of the Eiffel Tower, we took a boat trip with ‘Bateaux Parisiens’. It’s an one hour trip on the Seine that takes you along several highlights of Paris: Museé d’Orsay, Museé du Louvre, Notre-Dame, Hotel de Ville…  You can just sit back, relax and listen to the commentary they give to you in different languages.

    After all of this, we took a taxi back, because our feet didn’t want to walk anymore, I wonder why?
    After dinner, we went on a night tour. It’s a guided bus tour that takes you along the beautiful illuminated buildings of the city.
    The next day we took the subway to Montmartre to visit this nice neighborhood and Le Sacré-Coeur. Montmartre and Art go hand-in-hand. In the earlier days it used to be a mecca for many artists, writers and poets.

    Today you can still have your portrait painted at Place du Tertre by an artist if you like. And when you walk through this picturesque part of Paris, with the many art shops, you can still feel the atmosphere. The trademark of Montmartre still is Art!
    Le Sacré-Coeur  is a popular landmark of Paris which is built on the hill of Montmartre. You can visit this cathedral or just enjoy the magnificent view you have over Paris if you stand in front of it.Afterwards we walked back in to the city centre, to the hotel and picked up our luggage. We took the subway to Gare du Nord to return by train to Brussels.</p>

    Istanbul</h2>
<p>Istanbul has always been among the top on my list of cities I wanted to visit. And when I finally got the chance to go, I had to jump at the chance. And let me tell you, I was not disappointed. From the ornate architecture to the historic culture, I was completely fascinated.
    Exploring the street traffic and observing daily life in Istanbul was incredibly fascinating. From the food to the many different bazaars, I felt right at home and never wanted to leave. Istanbul just felt like the best mixture of people I’ve ever seen anywhere else.
    We stayed at the Conrad Hotel Istanbul Bosphorus. We chose this hotel because it is located in the lively Besikta area which is a 5 minute walk from the Bosphorus. Hotel is also beautiful with fully renovated guest rooms and suites and a stunning rooftop restaurant that offers an amazing view of the city. They also have indoor and outdoor pools which were great for my kids. 
    One of the most unique neighborhoods in Istanbul is <b>Balat</b>. This area is filled with colorful homes and buildings. Very rich in history and yet the least amount of tourists in this area. Which is perfect because this is the perfect place to snap some of the best photos if you’re looking for great shots.
    Then I visited Taksim. This area is similar to Time Square in NYC. Very crowded with people at all hours of the day. Go here for great shopping, shopping and nightlife experience. 
    After experiencing the nightlife there, I made my way over to Sultanahmet. This area is filled with tourists and with that comes higher prices, lots of souvenir shops and over populated restaurants. While I do recommend visiting this area, I would opt to dine/shop elsewhere for convenience and lower prices. 
    Lastly, considered to be one of the best neighborhoods in istanbul, Otakoy, was an area featured a picturesque view of the mosque on the bosphorus. This is the area we stayed in and trust me when I tell you, you will not run out of amazing views, restaurants, shops, and café options… all within walking distance. I truly enjoyed every aspect of Istanbul and would reccomend it to anyone looking for a fun and adventerous place to travel

<h2 id="Ljubljana">
    Ljubljana</h2>
<p>Ljubljana is known as the green city of Europe and is also a destination not to be missed when traveling to Slovenia. This city brings a beauty that is not inferior to magnificent cities like Paris or Venice. The Slovenian capital Ljubljana lies along the banks of the same name peaceful river. Although the city of Ljubljana is small, it is quite vibrant and bustling but gentle, romantic also. Especially when night falls is the great time to explore Ljubljana.
    Ljubljana is also an ancient city, so just walking along the river in the city, you will easily see Roman remains on the way.
    Ljubljana is influenced by an oceanic climate with mild weather, warm summers and moderately cold winters with frequent snowfall. The rainfall in this city is quite large, up to about 1400mm per year and evenly distributed in all months. This makes Ljubljana considered the wettest city in Europe. So, you should go between May and June (Spring) because this is the time when the weather is warm, pleasant which is very suitable for sightseeing and outdoor activities also. You should not come here during the peak season (Summer) from July to August because the city will be very crowded, stuffy and hotel as well as service prices will also increase.

Summer (July – August) is clearly the busiest time to visit, the street filled with tourists and summer temperatures are warm for outdoor activities. Travelers all over Europe flocking here very crowded.
Preseren Square is the heart of Ljubljana. From here, there are many roads lead to almost all of beautiful attractions of the city. The most prominent structure in the square is the pink church Annunciation in Baroque style. Right in the middle of the square opposite the church is a fountain. In the hot summer, it will periodically spray to humidify the air to cool down and for children play.
Also in the central square, there is a three-bridge (Triple Bridge) in a strange architecture, very beautiful, crossing the canal that divides the city in two parts. Ljubljana is surprisingly pretty. From any angle to take pictures is also beautiful, as long as you take the time to avoid tourists. That said, Slovenia is not as crowded as Western Europe. The atmosphere is much more relaxed.
Instead of visiting the church, you should follow the small cobbled streets of Ljubljana to see its peaceful, charming, a little crowded but not hustle and bustle or noisy at all. Sitting down to have something to drink and watch people pass by is also great. Eastern European climate in the summer is hot but right after you rest in a shade it is cool, just avoid the direct sunlight, you can relax anywhere.
What do young people do in Ljubljana? Visit Metelkova “art” street. This is an autonomous street art neighborhood, mainly young people and artists gather here. This street consists of countless of bars, pubs, nightclubs, art shops and so on. You can easily realize this street by the walls are painted in vibrant colors and above it hangs… shoes. I strongly recommend to visit this area, during the day it is quiet but unique, at night, it relives all the activities that young people love: live music, nightclubs, shops…
