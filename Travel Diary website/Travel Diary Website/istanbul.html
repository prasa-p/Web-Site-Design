            <p>Istanbul has always been among the top on my list of cities I wanted to visit. And when I finally got the chance to go, I had to jump at the chance. And let me tell you, I was not disappointed. From the ornate architecture to the historic culture, I was completely fascinated.
                Exploring the street traffic and observing daily life in Istanbul was incredibly fascinating. From the food to the many different bazaars, I felt right at home and never wanted to leave. Istanbul just felt like the best mixture of people I’ve ever seen anywhere else.
                We stayed at the Conrad Hotel Istanbul Bosphorus. We chose this hotel because it is located in the lively Besikta area which is a 5 minute walk from the Bosphorus. Hotel is also beautiful with fully renovated guest rooms and suites and a stunning rooftop restaurant that offers an amazing view of the city. They also have indoor and outdoor pools which were great for my kids. 
                One of the most unique neighborhoods in Istanbul is <b>Balat</b>. This area is filled with colorful homes and buildings. Very rich in history and yet the least amount of tourists in this area. Which is perfect because this is the perfect place to snap some of the best photos if you’re looking for great shots.
                Then I visited Taksim. This area is similar to Time Square in NYC. Very crowded with people at all hours of the day. Go here for great shopping, shopping and nightlife experience. 
                After experiencing the nightlife there, I made my way over to Sultanahmet. This area is filled with tourists and with that comes higher prices, lots of souvenir shops and over populated restaurants. While I do recommend visiting this area, I would opt to dine/shop elsewhere for convenience and lower prices. 
                Lastly, considered to be one of the best neighborhoods in istanbul, Otakoy, was an area featured a picturesque view of the mosque on the bosphorus. This is the area we stayed in and trust me when I tell you, you will not run out of amazing views, restaurants, shops, and café options… all within walking distance. I truly enjoyed every aspect of Istanbul and would reccomend it to anyone looking for a fun and adventerous place to travel
