        <p>Ljubljana is known as the green city of Europe and is also a destination not to be missed when traveling to Slovenia. This city brings a beauty that is not inferior to magnificent cities like Paris or Venice. The Slovenian capital Ljubljana lies along the banks of the same name peaceful river. Although the city of Ljubljana is small, it is quite vibrant and bustling but gentle, romantic also. Especially when night falls is the great time to explore Ljubljana.
            Ljubljana is also an ancient city, so just walking along the river in the city, you will easily see Roman remains on the way.
            Ljubljana is influenced by an oceanic climate with mild weather, warm summers and moderately cold winters with frequent snowfall. The rainfall in this city is quite large, up to about 1400mm per year and evenly distributed in all months. This makes Ljubljana considered the wettest city in Europe. So, you should go between May and June (Spring) because this is the time when the weather is warm, pleasant which is very suitable for sightseeing and outdoor activities also. You should not come here during the peak season (Summer) from July to August because the city will be very crowded, stuffy and hotel as well as service prices will also increase.
        
        Summer (July – August) is clearly the busiest time to visit, the street filled with tourists and summer temperatures are warm for outdoor activities. Travelers all over Europe flocking here very crowded.
        Preseren Square is the heart of Ljubljana. From here, there are many roads lead to almost all of beautiful attractions of the city. The most prominent structure in the square is the pink church Annunciation in Baroque style. Right in the middle of the square opposite the church is a fountain. In the hot summer, it will periodically spray to humidify the air to cool down and for children play.
        Also in the central square, there is a three-bridge (Triple Bridge) in a strange architecture, very beautiful, crossing the canal that divides the city in two parts. Ljubljana is surprisingly pretty. From any angle to take pictures is also beautiful, as long as you take the time to avoid tourists. That said, Slovenia is not as crowded as Western Europe. The atmosphere is much more relaxed.
        Instead of visiting the church, you should follow the small cobbled streets of Ljubljana to see its peaceful, charming, a little crowded but not hustle and bustle or noisy at all. Sitting down to have something to drink and watch people pass by is also great. Eastern European climate in the summer is hot but right after you rest in a shade it is cool, just avoid the direct sunlight, you can relax anywhere.
        What do young people do in Ljubljana? Visit Metelkova “art” street. This is an autonomous street art neighborhood, mainly young people and artists gather here. This street consists of countless of bars, pubs, nightclubs, art shops and so on. You can easily realize this street by the walls are painted in vibrant colors and above it hangs… shoes. I strongly recommend to visit this area, during the day it is quiet but unique, at night, it relives all the activities that young people love: live music, nightclubs, shops…
